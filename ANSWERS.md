  1. What is the single most valuable outcome for doctors in the first 3 months of use?
    
	 So, doctors in India are mostly tied up to the tasks which are basically non-productive in nature. Some may or may not be productive in nature.  Most of us are getting messages on our WhatsApp. Some of these are appointment requests. Some of these are patients sending their PDFs and images of their reports asking our opinion. Most of us get the consultation requests to be done immediately. Most of us are alarmed about some ECG. We never know that our WhatsApp has some incoming ECG, some PDFs or other things. Triaging whatsapp is important, and in bigger hospitals, people have their secretaries who are between this doctor and patient layer. Patients usually send their reports and their ECGs and PDFs and appointment requests to the secretary. And such secretaries make the life of doctors easier. They find out: Which of the patient is asking for the appointment - Which is requesting for the reports to be seen. Which is having some medical emergency and needs to be called to the hospital immediately. Appointment coordination is made very easy if there is an available secretary with the doctors.
	 I So what I want to see is every medical practitioner even in living in Tier 3 city of India having the capabilities of a staff that doctor in a corporate hospital in a Tier 1 city like Delhi and Mumbai has. And yes, I know that that there are apps available for almost everything that I've talked about. As doctors, we do not want to be fighting 10 different tools for this job. This is just wasting time thinking that you are saving time, and it does not frankly translate into increased productivity using all those tools. 
	 
2. What would make a doctor say “this is better than a human secretary”?
I have seen these secretaries work. They ask for holidays, they do not pick up phones for coordinating appointments when the duty time is off. They need a periodic raise in their salaries, and not everybody can afford a human help. It is not going to come free of cost, and it is a high pressure job. Most of the times, there can be conflict between our doctor and their secretaries because of some issues. The secretary might not take call when it is important, and they might not realize that what they did. Something which increases productivity, saves my time, saves my money, is continuously available, and takes care of a cognitive load would definitely be better than a secretary. 
 
  3. What should the product not do (explicit exclusions)?
   no doctor would like the secretary to auto prescribe on his or her behalf. That is for sure. I would not like my secretary replying to my patients on WhatsApp that you should be taking X and Y drug and come back to us with X and Y reports after four, five days without taking my approval. This is not... This is... Product should not do this. It should find out which of the patients who are asking for such help and I will write the prescription, maybe I'll guide the product to do this but it should not be auto prescribing and that is most important thing. Whether the product is living in EMR app or patient's WhatsApp and my WhatsApp, it should not be auto prescribing

  Users & Settings
  4. Which specialties are your first targets?
   I am a cardiologist, so my priority would be showing this to cardiologists first and general practitioners also because they would be easy to find and easy to target 
  5. Typical practice setting: solo clinic, multi‑doctor clinic, or hospital department?
  big hospitals already have secretaries available to the doctors, and my target is going for the solo clinics and individual doctors primarily in my initial setups. And maybe when I expand to a larger setup, then I'll think of how can we expand, how can we make the software better. Maybe we should be giving some hardware with it, or attaching some more features, bills, and missiles. Maybe we should be adding some capabilities of inter-departmental talk between the prescriptions. Those are the things I'll consider later on, but currently I'm targeting individual doctors. I'm thinking of increasing their productivity and decreasing their pains 
  6. How many patients/messages per doctor per day in your target setting?
   honestly, I did not get this question. In usual practice, what happens is none of the requests coming from the patients are declined by any kind of doctor 
  7. Are doctors or existing secretaries the primary users?
 primary users are the doctors only, not their secretaries. The aim is replacing secretaries 
  Workflow & Use Cases
  8. What are the top 5 message types you want the assistant to handle?
appointment request 
opinions on reports. Reports may be incoming in the form of PDFs, JPEGs, or PNGs 
OPD availability on the day.  the secretary usually tells the patients that Doxab is available on this particular day or not. So that is one of the requests that we usually get, and that is one of the requests that I want to be taken care of. 
some of the patients do not understand what is OD and BD, so at times that needs to be explained - although that would be simplified by the app that we are building. That would also be a prescription writer that would categorically tell the patients that OD and BD stand for. But sometimes patients do ask silly questions, which of the following medications are supposed to be taken in the morning, which of the following medications are taken to be in the evening. So that is one aspect that I would like to be taken care of. 
 then patients usually ask for alternative medications. Some of the times medications are not available in the pharmacy that they are looking for. So they ask for the alternative brand names that they want to use. Alternative brands, this is one thing that people like to know, and this is one of the common requests that we get in our messages 
 then there are messages in which patients usually ask, "With what kind of investigation should I come up with during my follow-up?" Those are some specialty-specific investigations. In my specialty, there is a certain number of tests that I usually order most of the post-PTCA patients, post-CABG patients. So, in every specialty, there is a set number of tests which usually patients are asked to get. It is not a pattern, but most of the tests make sense in majority of these people 
 
  9. What are the top 3 “urgent” cases the assistant must escalate immediately?
   medical emergencies have to be identified by all means and they should be escalated to the doctor immediately. Attention should be brought to both the doctor that some action is urgently required from your side, and also the patient should also be made aware that this is important 
  10. What is the ideal triage outcome set (e.g., respond, schedule, escalate, request info)?
  yeah, that makes sense. The response schedule escalates the request info that makes sense 
  11. How should the system handle after‑hours messages?
  so, that depends upon different specialties and different types of complaints which are incoming. Most of the times, when there is a routine request, I would like it to respond like a human would. Not to reply after office hours. Some doctors would like that after office hours also. Such a message as an interring. But all doctors would like that emergencies have to be correctly identified and escalated.

  Communication Channels
  12. Which channels are mandatory at launch (WhatsApp, SMS, phone, email, in‑app)?
  as far as I understand, nobody is going to install a separate app for this purpose. No patient is going to install a separate, untested app for merely talking to the doctor. I don't know of people who would gladly download apps that make no sense outside of consultations. I myself have encountered multiple apps which came and went by and nobody downloaded them. Most people would instantly delete them after talking to the doctor, so it would make sense if the  if the app system was connected to the doctor and the patient, things that people already use like WhatsApp, like SMS, like phone and like email.  in the initial phase, I would like WhatsApp and email functionality. There should be doctor-patient and patient-secretary communication going on over WhatsApp. The secretary should be able to send the prescription via WhatsApp and email to the patient who is receiving. This is the minimum I would want at in a starting phase.  later on, I would like to have this secretary talk. It should be able to talk to the doctor. It should be able to talk to the patients. It should have a voice.  this is a feature which can wait and we don't need to have this in v1 but definitely in future we should be having it 
  13. Are patients already using a specific channel that cannot change? 
  14. Do you need voice calls or only text/chat?

  Prescriptions & Documentation
  15. What is the minimum required prescription output format (PDF, print, WhatsApp image, etc.)? 
  the prescription output format required is:

- At least PDF
- Minimum we should be sending anybody is a PDF
- Sometimes, when people are sitting in the OPD, they would like to carry a printed format of the prescription with them, so print is also important
  15. Are prescriptions primarily handwritten today or typed?
   in majority of places, prescriptions are primarily handwritten by pen and paper  and I want to change that. I want to change the habits of a million doctors and bring them to this app. And I won't be able to do that if I increase friction in the workflows of the doctors 
  16. Do you want OCR from handwritten notes in v1, or manual entry assisted by AI?
   OCR is important because most of the documents that would be coming might require OCR in PDF understanding by the secretary. This is an important feature as far as I understand

  Data & Records
  17. What patient data is essential for v1 (name, age, diagnosis, meds, allergies, etc.)?
  18. Do you need full EMR storage or only a “conversation + summary” record?
   it is how I would like to think about the storage, so suppose a patient comes to me today by the name of XYZ. He has his identifiers, so I would like to be aware of his situation and comorbidities and treatment that I wrote if needed 5 years from now also  i should be able to talk to the agent in natural language and it should be able to fetch me the records from previous visits and I should be able to see those records by my own eyes and the agent should be having the capabilities to bring me the summary of all the previous records it has. And the records may be in form of his old PDFs that I am having and may be in form of old JPEGs that I am having, it may be in form of old prescriptions that I have stored. So records may be in multiple forms and my secretary or my agent should be able to talk to those, fetch information from those and present to me those prescriptions or data or PDFs. So the choice would be, at the end of the day, choice would be on me. If I want to manually analyze the records, I should be able to see it like we are currently doing with applications like a Practo and Helplix as of now or if I would like the AI to summarize it to understand what everything is there, so AI agent should also be having the capabilities to do it. 
    so if I tell you we see patients in four ways there are four ways by which we are encountering the patients in our OPDs. One patient is coming to our OPD for the first time and there is no previous history of any records or illness or medications taken. Second he's my own follow-up patient and he's coming with a prescription written by me previously. Third is patient has sought multiple health groups or he has seen multiple doctors outside my setting. Maybe he has gone to 10 different hospitals. Maybe he has gone to one different hospital and is now coming back to me. Number four is teleconsultation. So I would like all these four routes to be taken care of. There would be information which would be coming to me like for the first scenario and second scenario patient is my own follow-up patient so his previous and third scenario patient is my own follow-up patient. These records would be with me; it should be with me. So, my that is probably the easiest thing to do. Third scenario patient has already seen multiple doctors, so an easy thing to do in this scenario would be that I should be able to open my WhatsApp, send my secretary the information that I am sending such and such patient's records please summarize them for me. When I scan those by my WhatsApp and send my secretary those PDFs and all those Apex, my secretary would be able to deeply analyze everything and come up with a summary or a detailed chronological history of present illness or detailed medical records. It should be able to synthesize what all happened. This happened, this happened, this happened, this happened; then this was done, then this was done, then this was done. So that type of workflow should be possible. Fourth is teleconsultation. So, teleconsultation in teleconsultation, people usually send you your records. That's what I said the app should be able to show me the records when I want. When I ask the agent, it should be able to summarize from the records it has 
  19. How long should data be retained?
I have not decided on this one.
  Compliance & Safety
  20. Which Indian regulations or standards must be followed?
   in future iterations, I would like to be as heavily compliant as possible to as many regulators as possible. HIPAA compliance, and other compliance, and multiple compliances. I would like to solve them, but for v1, we can leave this compliance issue and we'll sort it out when we find some paying customers.  but broadly we should be making architectural decisions based on this consideration that we would definitely require some compliance things to be taken care of in the future. So we should not be making stupid decisions that would create problems for us in the future 
  21. What is your risk tolerance for AI errors (low/medium/high)?
  ai errors = end of app
  22. Should the assistant ever send medical advice directly to patients without doctor review?
   unsolicited advice, unmonitored advice, should never go out to patients without doctor's review 

  Integrations
  23. Do you need integrations with existing EMRs (HealthPlex, Practo) or start standalone?
   ease of migrating in and migrating out sounds interesting; that will be probably added in some later versions, not in this version
  24. Which external services are required (SMS gateway, WhatsApp Business API, payment, labs)?
   SMS, Whatsapp, Payment - this would be the minimum 
  25. Are there existing hospital systems you must connect to?
  no hospital systems to connect to in First version 

  AI Behavior & Controls
  26. How should the assistant explain uncertainty to patients?
  27. What should be the escalation thresholds for humans?
  28. Do you want templated responses or free‑form AI replies?
regarding 26-28 
This is what I would want from AI replies. I don't want templated responses; templated responses sound so much like coming from the 2020s, and we have moved so fast in the AI space in 2025, 2026, and 2024 that templated responses seem so 2010s 
in case of any uncertainty, the response should be given by the doctor itself. The query and things should be escalated to the doctor or someone who's managing the bot or the application 

  Deployment & Operations
  29. Cloud vs on‑premise vs hybrid?
  30. Do you need offline or low‑bandwidth support?
  31. Who will maintain the system (your team vs clinic IT)?
 now regarding questions from 29 to 31
I have thought about all the scenarios:

- Having a desktop app
- Having clouds
- Having a hybrid system
- I've thought about Railway
- I've thought about Versel
- I've thought about GCP
- I've thought about AWS

I've thought about everything that you can think of, I've thought about them. I am not able to come to a right conclusion. What should be my go-to for this system for deployment and operations? Since I'm not a DevOps guy, I don't have a training in this background. I would need your hand-holding, your guidance, and your discussions and your brainstorming from your end to help me decide on this.  obviously, this will not be maintained by the clinic guys. It would be maintained by us only, by me initially, and by my team, which will gradually expand. So the responsibility of running this and maintaining this would be on us 

  Business & Go‑to‑Market
  32. Pricing model preference (per doctor, per clinic, per message)?
  33. Who signs the contract and who pays?
  34. What is the expected onboarding effort per clinic?
 I thought that I would be running Google ads and Meta ads, and I would be taking demos in conferences  and I would be expanding my team to go and meet various doctors in their clinics and show them what our software is capable of. But that would be after we have onboarded some of the members to sustain the salary of sales guys

  Timeline & Resources
  35. What is your desired timeline for MVP?
  1-3 months 
  36. How many engineers/designers are available?
   there are only two engineers, Claude Code and Codex, that I have in my team  similarly, there are only two designers: Claude Code  with front-ended skills and Gemini CLI  I don't have the budget for developers, engineers, and DevOps team 
  37. What is your budget range for initial development and infrastructure?

  Metrics
  38. What metrics define success in the pilot (time saved, response time, patient satisfaction)?
  39. What is an acceptable error rate for triage/response?
